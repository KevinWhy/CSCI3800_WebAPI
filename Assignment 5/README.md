Assignment 5's proxy is based off of Assignment 4.
When analytics should be collected, the proxy makes multiple POST requests to the /analytics endpoint.

Note that Postman tests no longer require any environment variables.

For some reason, the Statistics Collector policy doesn't work for free accounts.
To prove that the policies are set up correctly, I've included a screenshot of the policies.
