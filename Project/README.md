This is all the code used for the final project.
The WebstormProj folder is the front-end website, which communicates to the backend proxy.
The backend proxy makes a request to see if the IP address is in a whitelisted country.
	If it is, that user can purchase a WHO-ver Board.

I think the whitelist is stored in a Usergrid database.
